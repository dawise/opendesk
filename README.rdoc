# OpenDesk Project

This project aim to change the way small team work toghther on projects.
Basically we provide a cosy private room over the web, so you can start
straight away chatting with your team.

It's a perfect tool for students groups, startup teams, or assocation fellows,
so they can :

* Start a discussion

* Comment on each other proposals

* Upload a file & image

* Archive visually their conversation

* Sign up in seconds.

See you soon online.
